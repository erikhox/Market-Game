# Market-Game
Very simple stock market simuulating game made in python

## Description
This is a basic stock market simulator game. It lets the player start off at the year 2000 as an 18 year old and progresses through like until 2023, trading Apple along the way. I created it with the intention to teach a investing motto, "time in the market is better than timing the market", or something along those lines. This is my first real python program/project and I am pretty proud of it.

## Instructions
1. download the zip file
2. unzip it anywhere
3. cd into it and download requriements with "pip install -r requirements.txt" without the quotes
4. run main.py to start the game
